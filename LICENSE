3. The FitnessGram Pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that
   progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter Pacer test
   will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts
   slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal *boop*. A
   single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound *ding*. Remember
   to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you
   fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will
   begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
